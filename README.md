Eat Da Burger? No. No. Eat The Burger.

# tDN Eat THE Burger.

## Description

Log orders to display prepared and paid burgers. MySQL, Node.js, Express and Handlebars enabled me to create an application that tracks the burger process from order sent to order ready for pick up. When a burger is ready to be sent the the cashier or ready for pick up it can be removed at the click of a button to always display each burgers order status.
